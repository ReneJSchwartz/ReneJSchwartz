Hi! Nice to see you here. I'm looking for employment or internship. Let's have a chat!

I've programmed [Astro Battlers TD](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1728980/Astro_Battlers_TD/) ðŸ¤© among dozens of other things.

- âš“ I'm all about game-, web- and software development and related skill sets.

[My GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Rene_) that has couple dozen closed source projects. 

Please check [Phaser Roguelike](https://github.com/ReneJSchwartz/phaser-roguelike) for a public code sample using TS, while the UE GAS code might interest the UE folk. My main strength lies in Unity and general programming and problem solving ability. 

The gap in my contribution chart in 2024 is due to working as a full time programmer.
