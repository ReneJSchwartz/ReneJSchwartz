Hi! Nice to see you here. I'm looking for employment in Game Dev or any software development opportunities, and new connections. Let's have a chat!

I've programmed [Astro Battlers TD](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1728980/Astro_Battlers_TD/) ðŸ¤© among dozens of other things you've also not heard of. My learning journey has been a long one.

- âš“ I'm all about game-, web- and software development and related skill sets be it design or project management.

[My GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Rene_) has couple dozen closed source projects. Same here in GitHub, I do closed source. The gap in my contribution chart in 2024 is due to working as a full time programmer. Sometimes I also design games, also right now in fact. Programming is the easy part. Knowing what to build is more important.

You can check [Phaser Roguelike](https://github.com/ReneJSchwartz/phaser-roguelike) for a public basic code sample using TS, while the UE GAS code might interest the UE folk. My main strength lies in strong programming and problem solving ability and engine knowledge. Recently I've used Godot due to its lightweight nature. This enables me to make games from anywhere with a low spec laptop.
