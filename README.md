Hi! Nice to see you here. I'm looking for employment (Game Dev) or internship (SWE) and new connections. Let's have a chat!

I've programmed [Astro Battlers TD](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1728980/Astro_Battlers_TD/) ðŸ¤© among dozens of other things.

- âš“ I'm all about game-, web- and software development and related skill sets be it design or project management.

[My GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Rene_) that has couple dozen closed source projects. The gap in my contribution chart in 2024 is due to working as a full time programmer.

Please check [Phaser Roguelike](https://github.com/ReneJSchwartz/phaser-roguelike) for a public code sample using TS, while the UE GAS code might interest the UE folk. I don't really believe in open source development for a living, lol. My main strength lies in Unity engine and strong programming and problem solving ability. Recently I've used Godot due to its lightweight nature. This enables me to code games anywhere with a low spec laptop.
